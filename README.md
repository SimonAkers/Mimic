# Mimic

A Java application and framework for managing and executing macros based on MIDI events.

## Planned Features
- [x] Built-in support for keybind macros
- [ ] Built-in support for script macros (Groovy, Jython)
- [ ] Multiple macro presets
- [ ] Plugin support
- [ ] Color support

## Contribute

Currently, I am still working on the base application, meaning that methods of contributing
are few until further development is completed. As of now, writing code documentation is
probably the easiest way to contribute.

If you are seriously interested in contributing directly to the code base right now, feel
free to email me at [`hayesakers@gmail.com`](mailto:hayesakers@gmail.com).
